# Machine Learning Algorithm Implementations

This repository showcases practical implementations of various machine learning algorithms and concepts.

---

### Algorithms:

* **[Regression](./Regression/README.md)**
    * **Description:** Implementation of various regression algorithms including Analytical Least Squares, Gradient Descent, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Ridge Regression with cross-validation, and Kernel Regression. Includes analysis of convergence, regularization effects, and kernel suitability.

* **[Spam Classifier](./Spam_classifier/README.md)**
    * **Description:** A spam classifier built from scratch using a Naive Bayes algorithm. This assignment involved custom data sourcing and preparation, feature extraction, and detailed evaluation of classification performance.

* **[PCA and K-Means Clustering](./PCA_&_KMeans/README.md)**
    * **Description:** Exploration of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction on the MNIST dataset and K-means clustering (Lloyd's algorithm) on a 2D dataset. Includes analysis of explained variance, image reconstruction, and evaluation of K-means effectiveness with suggestions for alternative clustering methods.
